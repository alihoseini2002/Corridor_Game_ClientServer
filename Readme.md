# ðŸŽ® Quoridor Game - Client-Server Project

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
This project is my **second-semester bachelor's assignment** for the **Programming** course at the **University of Tehran - Computer Science Department**.  
It is an implementation of the **Quoridor board game**, built using a **client-server architecture** in **C++**.

The project demonstrates basic concepts of network communication and game logic. It uses the lightweight and powerful `httplib.h` library to handle HTTP-based communication between the client and server.
